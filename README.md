PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This is a simple collaborative text editor made during my internship at CodTech. The main purpose of this project is to let multiple people write and edit the same text document together — all in real time. That means if one person types something, the other users can instantly see it appear on their screen without refreshing the page.

The project helped me understand how real-time applications work and how different technologies connect together to create a full-stack web app.

How It Works:

When a user opens the editor, a new document is created with a unique ID. This ID can be shared with others. Anyone who enters the same document ID can join and start editing the document together.

As soon as someone types or edits the content, the changes appear on all users' screens at the same time. This happens using WebSocket technology through Socket.IO, which allows constant communication between the browser and the server.

The content is also saved in a MongoDB database. So even if someone closes the editor and comes back later, the old text will still be there. This is helpful for long-term editing or teamwork.

Technologies Used:

I used the following tools and technologies to build this project:

HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend (the part users see)

Node.js and Express.js for the backend (the server side)

Socket.IO to handle real-time updates

MongoDB to store and load document content

Few of these tools were new to me, so this project was a great learning experience.

Features:

Here are the main features of the text editor:

Real-time collaboration – multiple users can edit at once

Auto-saving – your work gets saved as you type

Unique document links – share a link to work with others

Simple and clean design – easy to use for anyone

What I Learned:

Through this project, I learned:

How to connect frontend and backend using JavaScript

How WebSockets work for real-time communication

How to use MongoDB to store data

How to build and run a full-stack project on my own

I also learned how to deal with bugs and errors, and how to test the project step-by-step. It was challenging at times, but I enjoyed the process and learned a lot.

Conclusion:

This collaborative editor project was one of my first full-stack apps. It taught me how different parts of a web application work together and gave me confidence to build more projects in the future. I’m happy with the result and excited to keep improving it.
